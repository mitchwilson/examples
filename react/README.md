# React.js Coding Demo

A demonstration of creating a React Component then using it several times in a Web page.

## Running Demo

- View index.html served by a Web server.
- Click the example buttons in the page.
- View the source code using your Web browser.

One easy way start a Web server in any directory is to use Python (installed on all Macs, for example).

``sh
cd path/to/react
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
``
